### 1. Next.js

Next.js is a React-based web framework that simplifies the development of server-side rendered (SSR) and statically generated (SSG) React applications. It provides a smooth developer experience and efficient performance out of the box.

### 2. Drizzle

Drizzle is a collection of front-end libraries that make it easy to develop decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. It simplifies the integration of blockchain functionality into web applications, providing tools for state management, event listening, and transaction handling.

### 3. Git

Git is a distributed version control system that enables collaborative software development. It tracks changes in source code during development, facilitating collaboration among team members. Git helps manage different versions of the codebase, making it easier to roll back changes, collaborate, and maintain a clean development history.

### 4. Password Manager

A password manager is a tool for securely storing and managing passwords. It helps users generate strong, unique passwords for various online accounts and stores them in an encrypted format. This enhances security by reducing the risk of using weak or repeated passwords across different platforms.
